<%#
The configuration file defines the allowed commands and specifies access control information.

The configuration file format is lines of space- or tab-separated strings, where each line is:
  command subcommand executable [option=value ...] acl [acl ...]

Each command consists of a command, a subcommand, and zero or more arguments.
Each configuration line defines an acceptable command and subcommand (or,
if "ALL" is used as mentioned below under command and subcommand, a set of commands).
The first configuration line matching the received command is used,
so list more specific entries before more general entries.

Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.

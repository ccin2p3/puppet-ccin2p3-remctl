<%#
One or more entries of the form [method:]data, where method specifies an access control method to be used, and data contains parameters whose meaning
depends on the method.  If the method is omitted, the data is processed as described for the "file" method.

If method is omitted, acl must either begin with "/" or must not contain "=".  Otherwise, it will be parsed as an option instead.
If there is any ambiguity, prepend the method.

Each entry is checked in order, and access is granted as soon as an entry matches.
If no entry matches, access is denied.
